# iML-Anonymization

Nowadays, anonymization of personal data is important for privacy protection. 
Thus, before being able to process personal data for further analysis, the
 data needs to be anonymized.
The issue at hand is that the more data gets anonymized the less information
 is left to analyse. This leads to vague results.
Our research project tries to improve anonymization algorithms through 
interactive Machine Learning.
